# Advent of Code 2017
## Robert Haines

I've not used Ruby in anger for a couple of years, and I miss it. So I'm doing [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) in Ruby 2.4, with tests and all the trimmings.

Turns out Ruby has changed a lot!

### Usage

After cloning, and changing into the `aoc-2017` directory, run:

* `gem install bundler`
* `bundle install`
* `rake`

This will set everything up and run all the tests.

To run the solution for a particular day:

* `ruby -I lib <day>/run.rb`
